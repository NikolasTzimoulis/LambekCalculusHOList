# Deep Learning Proof Search for Lambek Calculus 
experiments with proving sequents of a Lambek calculus with HOList/DeepHOL

This project is based on [HOList](https://github.com/brain-research/hol-light/) & [DeepHOL](https://github.com/tensorflow/deepmath/tree/master/deepmath/deephol).

The directory structure of this repository is as follows:

* *calculus:* The HOL-Light definitions of the Lambek caclulus.
* *databases:* Theorem databases for use with HOList.
* *proofs:* Verified proofs generated by DeepHOL.
* *scripts:* Miscellaneous python scripts.
